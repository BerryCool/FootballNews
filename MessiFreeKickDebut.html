            <h4><i>All stats gathered from <a href = "https://www.transfermarkt.us" target = "_blank">www.transfermarket.us</a></i></h4>
            <p>As you can see, Messi's stats are not impressive compared to other players of a similar caliber. With the lowest goal per minute ratio, low playing time, and low assists (very unlike messi), it was clear he was not having a good time at PSG.</p>
            <p>With unimpressive stats, and
                a power struggle between him and other teamates, it seemed like Messi was on his way out. However, Inter Miami had other plans.</p>
            <h3>Inter Miami's new star</h3>
            <p>After spending over $100 million USD on <a href="#la-pulga">"La Pulga"</a>, Inter Miami made a gamble that Messi's career was in fact, not done. 
                This gamble certainly paid off, as Messi worked wonderse against Mexican club Crus Azul in a Legends Cup match.
            </p>
            <h3>A quiet game</h3>
            <p>It was a relatively quiet game for Miami v. Cruz Azul. Miami was one goal up, but this would not last. In the second half Azul Crus was gaining momentum, and the horizon didn't look good. </p>
            <h3>Messi enters the chat</h3>
            <p>Eight minutes into the second half the crowd roared. If you weren't paying attention, you may be wondering why, as nothing significant had happened, yet. Miami was winning 1-0 and the play was dead. 
                However, if you kept listening, you would hear the crowd chanting - "Messi!.. Messi!.. Messi!". It was time for the <a href="#GOAT">GOAT</a> to take to the pitch.
            </p>
            <h3>Messi reminds us why he's the seven-time Ballon d'Or winner</h3>
            <img src="images/messifreekick.jpg" alt="messi">
            <p>After an uneventful second half, the game was coming to a close of regular time. Crus Azul had equalized, and up until now, Messi was unable to tip Miami over the edge. However, in the <i>91st minute</i>, with zero minutes to spare,
                Inter Miami pushed one last time for a last-second attack. With only 4 attackers against 8 defenders, it look impossible for Miami to break through, but thats when Messi does what he does best.
                After receiving a pass from #17 Jose Martinez, an agressive tackle on Messi allowed him to draw a foul, being awarded a free kick about 22 meters from goal.</p>
            <p>With over 2 full-sized school bus lengths between him and the goal, it looked like a longshot, but Messi had done this <i>many</i> times before. And in the 94th minute Messi lines up the ball,
                takes aim, and hammers the ball into the top-left shelf of the goal - well beyond the outstretched goalkeepers reach. He had done the unthinkable once again!
            </p>
            <p>With no time left, the referee called an end to the match, fans roaring and Crus Azul players heartbroken. It was a true spectacle, and reminded us why Lionel Messi is the greatest of all time.</p>
